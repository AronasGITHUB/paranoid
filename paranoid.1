.SH NAME
paranoid \- A script to automatically verify files for integrity using various methods (sha256, sha512, GPG, OpenSSL).
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B paranoid
[\fIfile\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B paranoid
script verifies the integrity of a file by checking its existence and performing multiple verification methods.
These methods include:
- SHA256 and SHA512 checksum verification (both for individual files and checksum lists).
- GPG signature verification.
- OpenSSL-based checksum verification.

This program is designed for users who want to automatically ensure the authenticity and integrity of files, especially for paranoid security-conscious individuals.
.SH OPTIONS
The script takes the following arguments:
.TP
\fIfile\fR
The file to verify. If not provided, the script will show usage information and exit.
.SH USAGE
To verify a file, run the script followed by the file path. Optionally, you can also provide checksum files or GPG signatures for additional verification.

Example:
.PP
To verify a file named "example_file":
.nf
$ paranoid example_file
.fi
.PP
If the relevant checksum or signature files (e.g., `example_file.sha256`, `example_file.sha512`, `example_file.sig`, or `example_file.gpg`) are available in the same directory, the script will use them to verify the file's integrity.
.SH VERIFICATION METHODS
The following verification methods are supported:
.TP
.B SHA256/SHA512 Checksum
The script checks for corresponding `.sha256` and `.sha512` files for the provided file and verifies their integrity.
.TP
.B GPG Signature
The script checks for the presence of `.sig` or `.gpg` files and verifies them using GPG.
.TP
.B OpenSSL Checksum
The script verifies the checksum of the file using OpenSSL with the provided `.sha256` checksum file.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The script exits with the following status codes:
.TP
0
File verified successfully.
.TP
1
An error occurred or the file did not exist.
.TP
2
Missing checksum or signature file(s).
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Verify a file called `example_file`:
.nf
$ paranoid example_file
.fi
.PP
Verify a file `example_file` with SHA256 and GPG signature verification:
.nf
$ paranoid example_file
.fi
.PP
If the checksum or signature files are missing, the script will display a warning.
